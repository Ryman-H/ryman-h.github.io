### Senior Research Fellow — University of Oxford

I develop anatomically realistic phantoms and sensorised systems for medical training and translational research. My research spans soft robotics, medical devices, and embodied intelligence. I supervise doctoral and masters students and collaborate across engineering and clinical teams.
